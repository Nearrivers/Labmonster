## Labmonster
Name subject to change

Labmonster is a desktop software for fighting games enthusiasts. Especially those who play too much [training mode](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Lab).

## üí™ Features
- You can create graphs to visualize [RPS Situations](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=RPS) and better understand risk-reward
- You can create character sheets on a game-to-game basis and recreate your own [Dustloop wiki](https://www.dustloop.com/w/Main_Page) equivalent
- You can tell the software who are you playing and it will remember it. The next time you'll create a move of _another_ character that is punishable, the application will tell you how your character will be able to punish that move. You can rank punishes by what YOU prioritize in a game. Is it damage ? [Corner carry](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Corner%20Carry) ? [Oki](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=RPS) and so on... The software will tell you "here, this punish does more damage but this one has better Oki".
- You can launch a screen record and save the replay in the app
- Hugely inspired by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/):
  - Elements in the app will be linkable between each other.
  - Everything is a file located on your machine. I can't and will never be able to see them.

## üî® Installation
### Download
You can download the executable in the [release section](https://github.com/Nearrivers/Labmonster/releases) of the repository.

**Windows users**: I have not signed the executable and Windows will warn you about that.

### Build from source
You will need:
- [The Golang toolchain](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [The NodeJS toolchain](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- To follow the OS specific dependencies as listed on the [Wails installation page](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation#platform-specific-dependencies).
- You'll want to pass the wails [system check](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation#system-check)

## üí≠ Motivations
1) I was looking to use Obsidian for fighting games then thought to myself "Why not making something of my own ?"
2) I wanted to make something in Golang
3) I very much enjoy programming and fighting games

If you're interested by this project, please give a star.

## ü§ù Contributions
I do not take (nor expect) contributions for now. Since it's my first "serious" project (i.e. Project I intend to finish), advice about open source etiquette or anything code related is greatly appreciated !
